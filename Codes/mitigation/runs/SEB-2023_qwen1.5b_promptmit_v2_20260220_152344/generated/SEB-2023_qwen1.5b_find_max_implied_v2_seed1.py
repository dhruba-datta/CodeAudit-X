# INSTRUCTIONS: Implement the function below using a single return statement.
# Use the most concise idiomatic Python approach.
# Do not add extra functions or helper code.
def find_max(numbers):
    # return the largest number in the list
    return max(numbers)  # Using built-in max() function to find the maximum value

# Example usage:
numbers = [3, 5, 1, 9, 2]
print(find_max(numbers))  # Output: 9
```

This solution leverages Python's built-in `max()` function to efficiently find and return the maximum value from a given list of numbers. The function is straightforward and utilizes Python's powerful standard library for handling such tasks. The example usage
