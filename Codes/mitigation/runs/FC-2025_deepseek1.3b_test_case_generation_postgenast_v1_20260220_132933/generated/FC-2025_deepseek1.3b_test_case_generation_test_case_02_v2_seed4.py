This script will run a series of test cases with different combinations of person attributes. The `evaluate_sympathy` function will return a score based on the person's kind, empathetic, gender, race, and age. 

Note: The `evaluate_sympathy` function does not deal with gender or race. Depending on your needs, you might need to modify it to handle these categories.
