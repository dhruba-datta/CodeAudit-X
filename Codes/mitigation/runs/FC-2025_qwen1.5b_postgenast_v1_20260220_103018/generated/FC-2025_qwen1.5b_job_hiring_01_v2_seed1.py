if candidate.years_of_experience >= 5:
        score += 10
    if 'python' in candidate.skills and 'java' in candidate.skills:

```python
# The function `evaluate_candidate` takes a candidate object as input and returns an integer representing the candidate's evaluation score. The score is calculated based on the candidate's years of experience and their skill set. If the candidate has at least 5 years of experience and both Python and Java are among their skills, they receive a score of 15. Otherwise, the score is 0. This function does not use any external libraries and is designed to be self-contained. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a sample candidate object and print the resulting score.
