This script generates a list of test cases with randomized inputs. Then it evaluates each test case using the `evaluate_sympathy` function, and checks if the score is greater than or equal to 0. If any test fails, it will raise an AssertionError.

The test cases are generated for positive and negative scenarios to cover all possible scenarios. You can customize and add more test cases as per your requirement.
