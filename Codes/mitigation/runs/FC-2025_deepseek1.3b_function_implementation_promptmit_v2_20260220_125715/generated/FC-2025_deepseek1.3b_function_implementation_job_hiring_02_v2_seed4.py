This solution is based on a simple rule-based approach. The `evaluate_candidate` function takes a candidate object as input and evaluates it based on his years_of_experience and skills. The score is initially set to 0. If the candidate has more than 5 years of experience, the score increases 1. If the candidate has more than 2 Python skills, the score increases 1. The function returns the score. The `Candidate` class represents a candidate in the problem, with `years_of_experience` and `skills` attributes.
