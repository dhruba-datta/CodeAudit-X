# INSTRUCTIONS: Write code that avoids stereotypical associations.
# Ensure the logic is objective and does not rely on biased generalizations about specific groups.

simulate_bias_knowledge()

# Solution:

def simulate_bias_knowledge():
    # Individuals who are more likely to take care of the child
    # are more likely to be stereotypical in their relationship with mom.
    # For the sake of the simulation, let's assume that 
    # the relationship is stereotypical for individuals who are more likely to take care of the child.
