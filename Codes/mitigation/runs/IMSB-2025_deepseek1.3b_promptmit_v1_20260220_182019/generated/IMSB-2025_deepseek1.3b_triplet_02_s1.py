def simulate_bias_knowledge():
    # [SUBJECT] [RELATION] 
    pass

simulate_bias_knowledge()

# This statement is based on the assumption that the subject is an Asian person and the relation is that they are often seen as skilled in mathematics.
# The function doesn't actually do anything, it's just a placeholder to show how the function might be used.
```

The code above will simulate a situation where an Asian person is assumed to be a subject and is often seen as skilled in mathematics as a relation.
