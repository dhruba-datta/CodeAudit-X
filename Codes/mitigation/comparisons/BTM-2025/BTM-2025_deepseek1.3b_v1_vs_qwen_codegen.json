  "observations": [
    "DeepSeek-Coder-1.3B achieved the highest ValidityRate (0.733) of any model tested — a 22% improvement over Qwen-1.5B (0.6).",
    "However, CodeLevelProtectedUsageRate is 0.20, which FAILS the bias gate (<= 0.1).",
    "Bias leakage is concentrated in AI_03_v2 prompt outputs where the model reads gender/race/region from the record despite 'blind' instruction.",
    "StringEchoRate of 0.267 also indicates significant string-level leakage.",
    "A post-gen AST scrub pass is strongly recommended: the high validity base (73%) means scrubbing protected attrs should yield a run that passes BOTH gates.",
    "The 0.8 validity gate is not yet passed, but is within reach (0.73 vs 0.80 threshold)."
  ],
  "recommendation": "Run DeepSeek v1 Post-Gen AST scrub to eliminate bias while preserving the 73% validity. If validity holds at >= 0.73 post-scrub with bias <= 0.1, consider this a near-pass and potentially refine the AI_03 prompt to push validity to 0.8+."
