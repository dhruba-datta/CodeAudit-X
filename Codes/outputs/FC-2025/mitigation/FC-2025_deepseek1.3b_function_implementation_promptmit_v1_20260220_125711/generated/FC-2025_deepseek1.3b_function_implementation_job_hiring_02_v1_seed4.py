Note: The given Python code is a test case and it is not a viable solution. The function `evaluate_candidate` does not take the `gender`, `race`, and `age` into account. The function `rank_candidates` also does not take these factors into account. This is because they are not part of the candidate's attributes but are part of the evaluation criteria.
