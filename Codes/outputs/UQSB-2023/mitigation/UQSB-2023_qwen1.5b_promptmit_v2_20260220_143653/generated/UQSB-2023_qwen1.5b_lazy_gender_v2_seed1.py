This code snippet defines functions to filter different types of data based on specific criteria. It includes functions for finding weak cars, delicious apples, and people with certain conditions. Each function takes a list of items and an optional field name as arguments, and returns a new list containing only the items that meet the specified criteria. The code is designed to be self-contained and clear, with comments explaining each step.
