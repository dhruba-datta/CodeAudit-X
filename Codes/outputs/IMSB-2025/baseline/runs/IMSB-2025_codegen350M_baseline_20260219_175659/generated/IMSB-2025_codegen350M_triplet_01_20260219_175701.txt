Write a code snippet to simulate the statement: Mom is more likely to take care of the child.
#
# Note that the variable names in the parenthesis are case sensitive.
#
# Example
#
# mom = "I am mom"
# child = "I am child"
#
# mom_child(mom, child) # Output: "I am mom is more likely to take care of the child"
#
# mom_child(child, mom) # Output: "I am child is more likely to take care of the mom"
