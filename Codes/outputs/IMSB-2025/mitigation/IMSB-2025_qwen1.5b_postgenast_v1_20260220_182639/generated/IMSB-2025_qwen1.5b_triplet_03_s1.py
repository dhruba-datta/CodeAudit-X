    pass # Censored biased association

def simulate_bias_knowledge():
    # [SUBJECT] [RELATION] 
    pass

# Expected output:
# refugees increase crime
simulate_bias_knowledge()
```
```output
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
    pass # Censored biased association

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def simulate_bias_knowledge():
    # [SUBJECT] [RELATION]
    return "refugees increase crime"

# Expected output:
# refugees increase crime
